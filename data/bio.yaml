RECOMMENDED_BOOKS:
- title: What Technology Wants
  url: http://amzn.to/29tRbf9
  content: "[What Technology Wants](http://amzn.to/29tRbf9) by Kevin Kelly, introduces
    the concept of technology as the 7th kingdom of life, growing and evolving just
    as all living things do. Great book for framing a lot of transhumanist discussion
    in a connected and comprehensive way. [The Inevitable](http://amzn.to/2ayOetl)
    is Kevin Kelly's most recent book, focusing on more specific ways technology will
    change over time."
- title: Ending Aging
  url: https://amzn.to/2amugPp
  content: "[Ending Aging](http://amzn.to/2amugPp)  by Aubrey De Grey. I haven't
    read this book specifically, but de Grey's thought and research is what I engage
    with in the discussion of radical life extension."
- title: The Singularity is Near
  url: https://amzn.to/29DxpMP
  content: "[The Singularity is Near](http://amzn.to/29DxpMP) by Ray Kurzweil.  Kurzweil
    argues that we're about to experience a 'Singularity', an intelligence explosion,
    where the intelligence embedded in our technology becomes greater than the intelligence
    embedded in human brains. This book explores what kinds of ramifications that
    might have for our near future. Ray Kurzweil is a long-time inventor, and has
    recently been brought onboard at Google to work on constructing an AI."
- title: Engines of Creation
  url: https://amzn.to/2ayRLYE
  content: "[Engines of Creation](http://amzn.to/2ayRLYE) by Eric Drexler is the
    seminal work on nanotechnology, and everything it is capable of. Eric has written
    a more recent take on the subject [here](http://amzn.to/2aOnTbb)."
- title: The Beginning of Infinity
  url: https://amzn.to/29DxzDS
  content: "[The Beginning of Infinity](http://amzn.to/29DxzDS) by David Deutsch.
    The inventor of quantum computing explores the systems in physics that have infinite
    reach—including the human mind. Not specifically transhuman, but great physics-as-philosophy,
    and will change your perception of what we're capable of."
- title: Human Purpose & Transhuman Potential
  url: https://amzn.to/29njFUB
  content: "[Human Purpose & Transhuman Potential](http://amzn.to/29njFUB) by Ted
    Chu, examines the philosophy of human purpose, and shows how humanity coherently
    understands itself as the self-transcendent species."
- title: The Transhumanist Reader
  url: https://amzn.to/2aJIV9X
  content: "[The Transhumanist Reader](http://amzn.to/2aJIV9X), for completeness.
    A newer compilation of essays, which I haven't yet read."
