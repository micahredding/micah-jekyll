I’m dreaming of a…Or the ridiculous “Grandma got run over by a reindeer”?Or the fun and frivolity-filled “Jingle Bells”?Well, my favorite has got to be “Carol of the Bells”. Why? Because it’s the only Christmas song I can imagine being sung whole-heartedly by Scrooge himself. Think about the words:&lt;blockquote&gt;“Hark how the bells, sweet silver bells, all seem to say throw cares away…”&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here we have a nice lyrical section about the sweet sound of bells.

It’s dark and foreboding, ominous at least.&lt;blockquote&gt;“One seems to hear words of good cheer, from everywhere, filling the air…”&lt;/blockquote&gt;Sounds nice and pleasant, right? Well the tune is more in line with a guy on the verge of a mental meltdown. He knows the voices aren’t real; that’s why he only SEEMS to hear words of good chear, and they come at him from every corner of the room!&lt;blockquote&gt;“Oh how they pound! Raising the sound! O’er hill and dale, telling their tale!”&lt;/blockquote&gt;As the music beats to a crescendo, it conveys the very strong image of a guy being driven crazy by the incessant ringing of bells. He becomes progressively more frantic. And is driven inevitably to the conclusion.&lt;blockquote&gt;“Gaily they ring! While people sing! Songs of good cheer, Christmas…Is…Here!!!”&lt;/blockquote&gt;In no other Christmas song do I get the strong picture of some Scrooge-like madman running around yelling about “the bells! the bells!” while holding his hands over his ears.Which is why I think this Christmas-time celebration of insanity is so nice.
