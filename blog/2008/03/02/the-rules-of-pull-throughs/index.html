These rules are similar in nature to the rules for “Calling Shotgun”, having accumulated over time, developing in native societies for ages before modern civilization discovered them.&lt;blockquote&gt;Pull-Through Rule #1: IF A DRIVER PULLS INTO A PARKING SPACE WHICH IS AN INITIATOR, SAID DRIVER MUST TAKE THE PULL-THROUGH.

It doesn’t get any more logical than that.2. “If everyone did a pull-through, there would be no pull-throughs left”.That’s just not using simple reasoning. Think about it: if everyone completed the pull-through when given the chance, they would tend to leave their parking space more quickly once done, thus freeing up more parking that could potentially become a pull-through.3. “But this Pull-Through leaves me going the wrong way in a one-way lane!” Someone should have thought of that before creating the Pull-Through. It is not your fault that the Pull-Through is facing the wrong direction. You still must Take The Pull-Through.&lt;/blockquote&gt;To be continued…" />
