<meta name="description" content="A year ago today, I wrote down my resolutions for 2006. How well I’ve lived up to them is open to discussion, but here they are again.&lt;hr /&gt;I promised you my resolutions for this year, so here they are: &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;1) Write More Songs&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Writing songs is one of the few things in life that is good in itself. It doesn’t matter if people hear the songs, or if they ever get played on the radio; when you’ve written a really good song, just knowing that is rewarding. So I want to spend more time this year writing songs. And I want to write more interesting, and more varied, and more complex songs.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;2) Spend Less Time on the Internet&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;I was almost entirely without the internet for the last week and a half, and my lifestyle has been very different. I started doing more things just to be creative, started reading some books, and was more relaxed. I didn’t realize the internet took up so much of my time, and how very little of that time spent actually accomplishes anything.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;3) Spend More Time with People&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;In keeping myself busy with my work, my dayjob, my routines, the internet, and strategizing, I don’t always get as many opportunities to meet and spend time with people as I would like. So I’m going to try to do that more. I’m going to try to just goof off more.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;4) Eat &amp; Live Healthier&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;My habits of work, staying up until 1-2am, driving out of state every weekend, and eating a diet of slimfast, eggs, and peanut butter sandwiches is probably going to catch up with me at some point. So I’m going to try to switch up my diet from time to time…which will probably involve actually taking TIME to prepare food, rather than just slapping together whatever I’ve got. Guess my crazy rock &amp; roll lifestyle has got to slow down.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Anyway, those are my resolutions. Enjoy.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;-micah&lt;/div&gt;" />
