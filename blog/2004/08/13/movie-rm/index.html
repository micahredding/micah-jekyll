<meta name="description" content="RM is an abbreviation that means something about being a Mormon missionary. Never would have guessed that this would be a topic for a smart, irreverent, perfectly appropriate and family-friendly comedy that ranks up there with the best of today’s (usually less than appropriate) comedies. What makes it great is the soundtrack, which consists of redone traditional hymns alongside punk-rock sing-alongs about being a missionary. The irony pushes the soundtrack into True Greatness. Somehow or another, this movie manages to make fun of everything about Mormons (and a lot of church people, in general), without being offensive or sacrilegious. It’s not the greatest comedy, but it’s brave, original, and worth watching for the shear pleasure of being able to talk about a movie about Mormons. Mormons should like it too. 000 Three Cookies." />
