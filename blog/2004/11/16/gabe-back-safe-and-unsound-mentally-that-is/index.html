So since we’re dorks, we spent the day restructuring our sound system, because believe it or not, we couldn’t think of anything that would be more fun than that. In concert news, we just confirmed a concert for December 17 at The Colony Theater in Hillsboro, Ohio. It sounds like it will be pretty fun; we’re opening for some regional bands. The theater hosts around 150 teenagers at these rock nights. And I had a frozen Chai for the first time in a while. It was good. -micah" />
