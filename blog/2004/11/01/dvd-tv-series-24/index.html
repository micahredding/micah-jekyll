<meta name="description" content="I’m almost finished with the second volume of the first season. This is a great show, very original, entertaining and compelling. Everything happens in real-time, which is an awesome idea for a show. In other words, the show is an hour long, and covers exactly an hour of plot-time. When the show breaks for commercials, it comes back in exactly that length of time later. The season is 24 episodes long. It’s awesome. It basically has several different stories which intersect going on at the same time. The main guy’s daughter gets kidnapped, terrorists plot to kill a presidential candidate, the candidate has some personal family issues going on, etc, etc. And how awesome is it to watch a bunch of people stay up 24 hours at a time?
