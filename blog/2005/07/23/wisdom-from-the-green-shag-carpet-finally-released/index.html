<meta name="description" content="The all-new full-length CD from the Redding Brothers, entitled “Wisdom from the Green Shag Carpet”, has finally been released. The release party was held at the Borders Cafe last night and was a huge success. We were honored by the presence of the wonderful local singer-songwriter Bug Lilly (www.myspace.com/buggamile), who did an excellent performance to open the show, after which the new CD was officially released. The Redding Brothers explained the background of the album and then played a 50 minute set. Three separate drawings for free merchandise were held during the show, one for a T-shirt, one for a poster, button &amp; sticker set, and the grand prize drawing for the new “Wisdom from the Green Shag Carpet” CD. The new CD can be purchased in our online store here on the website, by clicking the “store” link at the top of the page. Thanks to everyone who helped out with our CD Release Party, especially to the Borders Cafe staff, Bug Lilly, Tiffany, Steve (for coming to our CD Release Party even after a long trip :-), Reda, and to everyone who helped out. Thanks again!" />
