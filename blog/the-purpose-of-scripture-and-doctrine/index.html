They point us to the visions and values that helped previous generations find life. They didn’t find that life by rejecting everything that had come before, nor by refraining from critiquing it.

<p>Christianity has died again and again. But each time it has been resurrected, reborn to new life.</p>

<p>The result of those deaths and rebirths is what we experience as scripture and doctrine. They point us to the visions and values that helped previous generations find life. They didn’t find that life by rejecting everything that had come before, nor by refraining from critiquing it. Instead, they grappled with it, wrestled with it, took it into the wilderness—and came back with something new and powerful, carrying forward and revitalizing the heart of the old.</p>

<p>This is what we see in Jesus, Paul, and the first disciples. It’s what we see in Moses, David, and the prophets. It’s what we see in the Reformers, the Restorationists, and throughout church history.</p>

<p>It’s what I think we need today. We cannot really cut ourselves off from our past, and so we must either reject it, or renew it. But having experienced power and beauty in something, most of us cannot bring ourselves to fully reject it.</p>

<p>And if we don’t find our way towards renewal, we’ll be caught in a dark limbo.</p>

<p>This is my way out, my fundamental step on the path to life:</p>

<p><strong>I believe in life, and I believe in humanity. And I believe in a God who believes in both.</strong></p>

<p>This God calls and equips us to share his purposes. “All that I have is yours”, God says, asking us to join in and care for life and humanity just as he does.</p>

<p>That’s the <a href="http://micahredding.com/blog/partnership-with-god">entire biblical story</a>. It’s the Greatest Commands. It’s love.</p>

<p>And doctrine and scripture and all the rest—when they’re good, healthy, functional, life-giving—are how we keep reminding each other of these facts.</p>
